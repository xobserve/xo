Time system in Datav is very simple: when you picked a time range, that time range will be used in all dashboards.

## Time picker 

Time picker is located at the top right corner of the dashboard. There are four ways to set the time range, the mose common way is select the quick times.


### Quick select 

Quick select always select a time range relative to current time. For example, if you select `Last 1 hour`, it will select the time range from 1 hour ago to now. 

So when you refresh the dashboard, it will always show the latest data in the last 1 hour.

This relative time range is showed as `now-1h to now` both in the time picker and the url.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/quick-time.jpg').default.src} alt="quick-time"  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"  width={3086} height={1658}/>

There are four places in above image shows `last 1 hour` or `now-1h to now`, can you find them all? 

### Custom time range

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/custom-time-range.jpg').default.src} alt="custom-time-range"  style={{height: "400px"}}  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"/>

Here shows another way to set time range, look at the left part of above image, you can directly input the time range you want. 

In above image, we first select `Last 1 hours`, and modify `from` field in `Custom time range ` section, then click `Apply time range` button to make the changes take effect.

You can see: with the time change from `now-1h to now` to `now-30m to now`, the data in the panels also changed, that's nice and also intuitive..



### Select calendar

Have you seen the two calendar icons besides `from` and `to` fields? You can click them to select a date range in calendar.

### Modify url

When you select a time range, the url will be changed at the same time. Try to modify `from` and `to` params in url and refresh the page to see what will happen.


## Sync to local storage

When you select a time range, it will be saved to local storage in browser. If you refresh the page, the time range will be restored from local storage.


## Refresh 

Sometimes we hope to refresh the dashboard data automatically, for example, refresh the dashboard every 60 seconds.

This is easy to do in Datav, just select a refresh interval next to `Refresh` icon in the top right corner.

If you just want to refresh the dashboard once, you can click the `Refresh` icon directly.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/tutorial/refresh-icon.jpg').default.src} alt="refresh-icon"  style={{height: "50px"}}  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5"/>
