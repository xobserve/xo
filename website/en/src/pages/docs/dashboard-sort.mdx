If you are the `Admin` of `Datav`, sometimes you may want to arrange some dashboards at the top of the `search modal`, such as the dashboard represent the new features of Datav.

You can set the `sort priority` of the dashboard to achieve this.

> Only the `Admin` of `Datav` can modify the sort priority of dashboard.

## Set sort priority
Now let's set the sort priority for `Host info` dashboard to make it be shown at the top of search modal.

Here is a image of the current sort orders: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/dashboard/default-sorts.jpg').default.src} alt="default-sorts" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

`Host info` is at the 3th place in the list. Let's modify its sort priority: click the `0` number which the arrow points to in the image

<img src={require('@/img/docs/dashboard/modify-sort.jpg').default.src} alt="modify-sort" style={{height: '100px'}}  className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

## Final result

Set the new priority to 50 and press `Enter` to save it, now you should see the sort order has been changed:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/dashboard/after-modify-sort.jpg').default.src} alt="after-modify-sort" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Try to modify other dashboard's sort priority to see the effect.
