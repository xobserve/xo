In Datav, you can set options for overall charts, when these options is set, every series in the chart will inherit these options. 

But somtimes we hope to override some options for a specific series, now you can do it with `Panel Overrides`.

## Create a panel 

First, create a panel and select `Graph` visualization, then add datasource queries as below: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/panel-with-two-queries.jpg').default.src} alt="panel-with-two-queries" style={{height: '260px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Don't forget to set `Legend` field to `{{__name__}}` to display their series name in graph legend.

> This panel will be reused in the next `Thresholds` and `Interactivity` docs 

## Set common options 

Now, you can see there are two series in the `Graph` chart: `node_load1` and `node_load5`, let's set some common options to them.

### area fill 

The below options will change the area fill style of all series in the chart:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/fill-area.jpg').default.src} alt="fill-area" style={{height: '260px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

### unit 

Now, let's set the unit of all series in the chart:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/unit.jpg').default.src} alt="unit" style={{height: '260px'}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

It should be noted that value in `Unit` is actually ` / load5` with a `space` char at the beginning.

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/panel-with-common-options.jpg').default.src} alt="panel-with-common-options" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

This is a bit weird, `load1` series is also using a `load5` unit. Let's fix it first.


## Override options

To fix the unit issue, the only way is to override the options for `load1` series.

But if you look at the `Graph` panel, you will find that there is no Y-axis space for `load1` series to show its unit ` / load1`.

So we need to add a new Y-axis for `load1` series, and set its unit to ` / load1`:

### Add override item to `load1` 

Click `Override` tab and add a new override for `load1` sereis as below:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/override-item.jpg').default.src} alt="override-item" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

### Add Y-axis override

Click `Add override rule` and select `Series.separateYAxis` type ,then enable it as below: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/yaxis-override.jpg').default.src} alt="yaxis-override" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Where the arrow points to is the new `Y-axis` we set for `load1` series.

Now it's time to set its unit.

### Add unit override 

Click `Add override rule` and select `Series.Unit` type, then set its value as below and click `Submit` button: 

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/override-unit.jpg').default.src} alt="override-unit" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

Nice, now the `load1` series has its own Y-axis and unit.

But there is also a problem: the `load1` and `load5` series are shown mixed together. Maybe we should separate them.

A viable approach is show `load1` in `negative y-axis`.

### Add negative y-axis override

For now, we don't need `separateYAxis` any more, so change it to `negativeY` as below:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/negativey-override1.jpg').default.src} alt="negativey-override1" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />


Ok, the two series never mixed together now and the units is also correct. Let's override some styles next.


### Override color and fill 

Add some overrides as below :

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/styles-override.jpg').default.src} alt="styles-override" style={{height: "400px"}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />

<TextList>
    <li>Override `Series.style` to change `node_load1` series from `Lines` type that set in common options to `Points` type</li>
    <li>Set `Series.fill` it to `10` for `node_load1` to make it less opacity</li>
    <li>Remove the line from chart by seting `Series.lineWidth` to 0 </li>
    <li>Assign a new color to `node_load1` rather than using a default color by seting the `Series.color` override</li>
</TextList>


## Final result

After all these overrides, the final result is not bad:

<img src={require('@/img/docs/panel/override-final.jpg').default.src} alt="override-final" style={{height: "300px"}} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />
