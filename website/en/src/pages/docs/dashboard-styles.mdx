For basic styles usage, please refer to [tutorial](/docs/tutorial-home#make-home-more-beautiful).

Here let's see how to use custom background image.

1. Open settings modal of `Home` dashboard and select `Styles` tab.
2. Click `Background` field, don't select any item, just paste this string `https://github.com/data-observe/assets/blob/main/dashboard/demo-background.jpg?raw=true` to input box
3. Press `Enter` key
4. Set `Background color mode` to `Light`, because out background image is a light image.
5. Set `Enable background` to `true`

Go back to `Home` dashboard, you will see the background image is applied.


<img src={require('@/img/docs/dashboard/custom-background.jpg').default.src} alt="custom-background" width={3086} height={1658} className="rounded-lg ring-1 ring-black/5" />
