## Syntax support

Tailwind CSS uses a lot of custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@screen`, and in many editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren't recognized.

The solution to this is almost always to install a plugin for your editor/IDE for PostCSS language support instead of regular CSS.

If you're using VS Code, our official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin includes a dedicated Tailwind CSS language mode that has support for all of the custom at-rules and functions Tailwind uses.

In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.

## IntelliSense for VS Code

The official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

- **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as [CSS functions and directives](/docs/functions-and-directives).
- **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
- **Hover Previews**. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it.
- **Syntax Highlighting**. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.

Check out the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/tailwindcss/intellisense) to learn more, or [add it to Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to get started now.

## Automatic class sorting with Prettier

We maintain an official [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts your classes following our [recommended class order](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

<img src={require('@/img/prettier-banner.jpg').default.src} alt="" width={2400} height={819} className="rounded-lg" />

It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind configurations, and because it’s just a Prettier plugin, it works anywhere Prettier works — including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command line.

```html
<!-- Before -->
<button class="text-white px-4 sm:px-8 py-2 sm:py-3 bg-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-800">...</button>

<!-- After -->
<button class="bg-sky-700 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-sky-800 sm:px-8 sm:py-3">...</button>
```

## JetBrains IDEs

JetBrains IDEs like WebStorm, PhpStorm, and others include support for intelligent Tailwind CSS completions in your HTML and when using `@apply`.
